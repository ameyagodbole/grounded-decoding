The first known writer to use it (certainly in any clear and developed way) was Aristotle, who argued that the natural progression of human beings was from the family via small communities to the polis.\\nMany writers from ancient times to the present have seen parallels between the family and the forms of the state. In particular, monarchists have argued that the state mirrors the patriarchal family, with the people obeying the king as children obey their father.\\nAncient Greek thought[edit]', 'title': 'Family as a model for the state - Wikipedia'}, {'id': 'doc_6', 'snippet': 'Aristotle often describes personal and domestic relationships in terms of different forms of government. He gives examples such as men and their domestic animals, wives, slaves, and children. He says, for example: \"the government of a household is a monarchy, since every house is governed by a single ruler.\"(2)/ \"The rule of a household is a monarchy, for every house is under one head\"[2] Later in the same text, he says that husbands exercise a republican government over their wives and monarchical government over their children, and that they exhibit political office over slaves and royal office over the family in general.

      "Should a political community be governed in the same way as a family?\n",
      "The idea that a political community should be governed in the same way as a family is a theory of political philosophy called 'Family as a model for the state'. This theory explains the structure of certain kinds of state in terms of the structure of the family. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aristotle, in his Politics, was a strong advocate for this approach, stating that \"the government of a household is a monarchy, since every house is governed by a single ruler.\" He also said that husbands exercise a republican government over their wives and monarchical government over their children. Aristotle's view implies that the state is a reflection of the patriarchal family, much like a king is reflected by his subjects. \n",
      "\n",
      "This theory has been largely employed by monarchists and aristocratics to mirror the hierarchical dynamics of the family unit. In aristocratic nations, the social institutions only recognise the father as the authority figure; thus, he acquires a political right to command his family. The government of such nations never makes a direct appeal to the governed, believing that leading the foremost is enough for the rest to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, other forms of government do not necessarily follow this family structure. For instance, in democracies, a father is only regarded as an older and richer community member—the government picks off every individual to adhere to the community's general laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, although the theory of 'Family as a model for the state' is widely associated with Aristotle's view of monarchy, other forms of government may not adhere to the same family structure.\n",

      "Does the ability to think presuppose linguistic competence?\n",
      "Linguistic competence refers to an individual's unconscious or tacit knowledge of the structure of their language, which allows them to use and understand it. Sources argue that children effortlessly acquire this competence, indicating that linguistic knowledge precedes speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "In pragmatics, a branch of linguistics, presupposition (or PSP) is an implicit assumption about the world or a background belief relating to an utterance whose truth is taken for granted in discourse. Presuppositions are a property of the main verbs in sentences. Negating a sentence does not change its presuppositions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the ability to think does not presuppose linguistic competence, because even without linguistic competence, one can still hold the capacity to think and form presuppositions. Furthermore, the linguistic competence theory proposed by Chomsky distinguishes between competence, which is the unconscious linguistic knowledge, and performance, which is the use of language in practical situations. This implies that the ability to think, being associated with competence, exists separately from language performance. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's also important to note that presuppositions are not limited to linguistically competent individuals. A presupposition trigger, such as a change of state verb or an iterative, implies a previous state of affairs. For example, the sentence \"The flying saucer came again\" presupposes that the saucer came before. Such triggers are not dependent on linguistic competence.\n",

      "Does linguistic competence presuppose the ability to think?\n",
      "The term 'linguistic competence' is used by speech experts and anthropologists to describe how language is defined within a community of speakers. Linguistic competence is closely related to the concept of generative grammar, which argues that all native speakers of a language have an unconscious understanding of the rules governing the language. According to Noam Chomsky's theory on linguistic competence, it is an innate linguistic knowledge, that allows a person to match sounds and meanings, and is therefore a natural ability with which children are born. This knowledge is tacit, or implicit, meaning that it is unconsciously possessed, and people do not have conscious access to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some linguistic theorists see linguistic competence as an ability that presupposes thinking, as it involves an understanding of the rules and construction of language. Competence, in this sense, is idealized and only functions under certain conditions, free from emotion, memory loss, distraction, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, other researchers ignore Chomsky's definitions of competence and study language as a practical function of human behaviour. From this perspective, linguistic competence is a learned behaviour and not necessarily linked to thinking, as it does not require the conscious understanding of language rules. Chomsky's theories have sparked much debate among linguists, and many have criticised his distinction between competence and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "This concept remains an important aspect of linguistic theory and education, and researchers continue to study and refine it.\n",

      "Most people consider themselves to be good and hope to act ethically especially in pivotal moments. However, decades of research have shown that people's moral judgment can be clouded by psychological and social processes, leading them to act contrary to their values. The notion of moral superiority, especially in relation to others, can have negative consequences such as reducing the willingness to cooperate, create intolerance and even lead to violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "The sources suggest that to build an ethical career, one ought to adopt a mindset of moral humility, acknowledge the potential for ethical transgressions and implement safeguards against them. One way of doing this is by adopting a three-stage approach involving preparation, decision-making in the moment and reflecting on past actions. \n",
      "\n",
      "While the responsibility to act ethically lies with the individual, the sources also indicate that most people's perception of themselves as morally superior to others is irrational and rooted in a phenomenon termed the \"self-enhancement\" effect. People should thus strive to be morally vigilant, reflect on their actions and implement safeguards, but also be aware of the cognitive biases that might lead them to believe they are acting more morally than they actually are. Across the population, the pursuit of the most morally valuable career might be difficult owing to the aforementioned psychological effects. However, a collective effort towards this goal could prove beneficial to society.\n",

Some Christian denominations, such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, view God the Father as married to a female, Heavenly Mother. The Catholic Church states that God \"transcends the human distinction between the sexes\" and is neither man nor woman.\n",

      "In Judaism, the Tanakh refers to God with masculine imagery and grammatical forms, but Jewish philosophy does not attribute sex to God. Some modern Jewish thinkers view God as existing outside the gender binary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Islam, God (Allah) is viewed as transcendent and beyond any gender attributes. Arabic, the language of the Quran, has no gender-neutral pronouns, so God is typically referred to using the masculine form.\n",

In recent years, many universities in the West have been recipient to large donations from Russian oligarchs, notably including Cambridge University which received £3m from Vladimir Potanin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some argue that donations from oligarchs help universities to become more financially stable and enable them to award more scholarships. These donations may also help to establish positive relationships between the university and the donor, as seen with Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash and Cambridge University. Firtash funded several scholarships at the university and was invited to an annual dinner as part of the elite Cambridge Guild. The university also awarded him a medal for his philanthropy. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, such donations have faced a lot of criticism. Many believe that oligarchs donate large sums of money to \"launder their reputations\" and integrate themselves socially and financially in Western society. This may also apply to the children of oligarchs who hope to get into prestigious universities. Hence, universities risk losing their credibility and moral integrity by accepting donations from questionable sources. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, several universities have faced calls to distance themselves from Russian donors. Oxford University, for example, has been urged to cut its ties with Russian money, including donations from Vladimir Potanin.\n",

Because of this, some jurisdictions have ruled that strip searches are only lawful when the person being searched has been legally arrested for a crime. Some sources assert that strip searches should only be allowed when authorized by a senior officer and conducted by an officer of the same sex as the individual being searched. Additionally, it should only be carried out in the presence of officers of the same sex as the individual and never in a degrading manner.

Restorative justice involves going to the people who have been harmed and helping them find a solution which could involve the government intervening in a way that helps the victim feel better. This could also involve responding to the problems of the perpetrator in a way that would help them avoid similar conduct in the future. \n",

They also claim that animal research is highly regulated with laws in place to protect animals from mistreatment. Animal experiments are also conducted to avoid putting human volunteers in danger and some experiments involve genetic manipulation that would be unacceptable to impose on humans. Furthermore, animals often make better research subjects than humans because of their shorter lifespans, which allows researchers to study the effects of treatments over several generations quickly.\n",
      "On the other hand, opponents of animal testing find the practice to be cruel and inhumane, with Animal Society International stating that animals used in experiments are subjected to infliction of pain, wounds and force feeding. They argue that using alternatives to animals in research would be more ethical. Some companies skipped animal testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating that animal testing is not always necessary. Furthermore, there is little predictive value in animal experiments due to differences in physiology between species. Using chimpanzees, for example, which share 99% of their DNA with humans, has proven to be an unreliable method of predicting human responses. \n",

      "The availability of genetically modified foods in grocery stores has been a topic of debate for years now. Genetically modified foods have many benefits but also pose some risks to human health and the environment.\n",
      "Genetically modified foods have several advantages:\n",
      "- They have an increased shelf life, reducing the fear of foods spoiling quickly.\n",
      "- They are nutrient-rich, containing higher amounts of vitamins and minerals and improved flavours compared to traditionally grown foods.\n",
      "- They can help feed the population in times of drought or poor soil conditions.\n",
      "- They can be modified to resist diseases and pests, reducing the need for pesticides and insecticides and making them environmentally friendly.\n",
      "- DNA modification can help eliminate properties that cause allergies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The health risks of consuming genetically modified foods are concerned with the presence of toxins, allergens, or genetic hazards. Unforeseen changes in the genetic makeup of foods may occur, leading to unpredictable allergenic effects. The long-term effects of consuming genetically modified foods are mostly unknown. This lack of knowledge about the effects on human health makes many people hesitant and wary of such foods. \n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the health concerns, there are also ecological concerns related to genetically modified crops. There is a possibility of damage to other organisms in the environment due to cross-pollination. Genetically modified crops may have a negative impact on the ecosystem and contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, more research is required to understand the extensive implications of genetically modified foods on human health and the ecosystem before they can be universally accepted. However, they should not be prohibited outright, given their potential benefits in the face of global challenges like food security in adverse climatic conditions, malnutrition, and poor soil quality.\n",

      "The question of term limits for lawmakers is a highly debated topic, with powerful arguments on both sides. Term limits may curtail the forces of corruption and stabilize the government by limiting the time elected officials can spend in power. Additionally, supporters of term limits argue that this would be an effective mechanism for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Congress and government. Term limits would also ensure that lawmaking power is not concentrated in a small group of individuals, thereby allowing new representatives with fresh perspectives to enter the legislative process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opponents of term limits for lawmakers argue that this system would result in a significant loss of experience and institutional knowledge. Lawmakers gain valuable skills and expertise from their work, and term limits would force these skilled individuals out of the job, which could be detrimental to the legislative process. Furthermore, the argument that elections are unable to remove unresponsive or ineffective members of Congress is invalid, as constituents can achieve this themselves by voting. Term limits would also increase the influence of lobbyists and special interests, as novice legislators would rely on them to fill their own informational gaps. \n",
      "\n",
      "Term limits have never been implemented at the federal level in the United States, but some states have implemented them for their state legislatures. Voters in six additional states voted in favor of term limits, only to have their votes nullified, while in two states, the state legislature nullified the limits. \n",
      "\n",
      "Political scientists have studied the impact of term limits in these states, and some studies find that these limits exacerbate the issues advocates hope to curtail by imposing them. Therefore, the evidence suggests that term limits may not be a viable solution, and other mechanisms, such as elections, should be relied upon to remove ineffective representatives.\n",

      "Should countries practice universal basic income?\n",
      "Universal basic income (UBI) is a social welfare proposal under which all citizens of a country regularly receive a guaranteed minimum income. This is given in the form of an unconditional transfer payment - that is, without the means test or need to work. Should countries adopt UBI is a much-debated topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "UBI has been increasingly discussed across the world, especially as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Temporary direct cash transfer programs were introduced by around ninety countries and regions, including the United States, Spain, Hong Kong and Japan. Polls conducted during the pandemic suggested widespread support for UBI in public opinion. A 2020 study by Oxford University found that 71% of Europeans are in favour of basic income. A Pew Research Center survey from the same year, however, found that 54% of US adults oppose the federal government providing a guaranteed income of $1,000 per month to all adults, while 45% support it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous pilot projects for UBI have been carried out. In 2020, Germany began a UBI trial where people received about $1,400 monthly for three years. A similar project was launched in Wales the same year. Finland conducted a two-year UBI trial and Ontario launched a basic income pilot for 4,000 people in three cities. A small village in Kenya implemented a UBI program and claimed to have achieved stabilizing results. A basic income project in India also reported positive findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several welfare arrangements that can be considered similar to UBI, such as child benefit or pension. Furthermore, some argue that UBI could be a solution to automation, fewer jobs, and lower wages. UBI is also advocated for by some politicians and thinkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main arguments against adopting UBI are likely to be economic, coupled with the fact that such a scheme would be extremely expensive to implement. For instance, a majority of Americans oppose a universal basic income, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, although no country has a full UBI scheme in place, many countries are moving towards accepting and implementing pilot projects in this area. The pandemic has strengthened the case for introducing such policies, at least temporarily, as a form of crisis management. Whether countries should practice UBI will remain a matter of debate until more conclusive evidence supporting UBI's success - or otherwise - emerges from these trials.\n",

      "Should people be able to grow their own food in metro cities?\n",
      "Urban farming, a term that covers all sorts of farming in and near cities, has taken off in the last few years. Various forms of urban farming such as indoor farming, community garden stewardship and rooftop production come with many benefits and contribute significantly to making the food system more sustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FAO estimates that a one-metre square garden plot can produce 20kg of food per year. Having the opportunity to grow food in cities not only reduces food waste but also provides an opportunity to reconnect with nature and learn about the current global food system's shortcomings. \n",
      "\n",
      "With the world's population largely concentrated in cities, the practice of urban farming could potentially make the food easily accessible and available to many. Additionally, growing food locally also reduces the carbon footprint left by food transportation. \n",
      "\n",
      "So yes, people definitely should be able to grow their own food in metro cities. There are multiple ways to do so, some of which have been listed below.\n",
      "- Plan your garden and buy peat-free soil \n",
      "- Focus on microgreens if you have a small apartment with no outdoor space\n",
      "- Vertical farming\n",
      "- Join a community garden\n",

      "The idea of universal basic income (UBI) is not a new one. Thomas Paine, for example, proposed a similar tax plan in the 1700s. UBI is a government programme under which every adult citizen receives a regular, set amount of money. The theoretical goals of such a system are to reduce poverty and cut bureaucracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interest in UBI has increased in recent years, due to economic stressors, increased automation and wealth disparities. Small-scale experiments have been conducted to test the waters, including a two-year experiment in Finland. \n",
      "\n",
      "Supporters of UBI claim it could be a way of ensuring citizens' financial security, particularly in times of economic crisis, and might help those who are left behind by the increasing automation of the economy. They also suggest it could reduce the size of government and cut the cost of social programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, UBI is expensive and there is little evidence to suggest it would increase employment. Critics worry that recipients would become reliant on the government handouts and neglect their jobs, which could hurt the economy. It's also argued that UBI might result in reduced social programs, which could negatively impact the poorest in society.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no clear consensus on whether or not governments should introduce UBI. Proponents and opponents have valid points, and the policy itself is complex. There are also many different motivations for introducing it, depending on the context.\n",

      "The purpose of minimum wages is to protect workers against unduly low pay and ensure a just and equitable share of the fruits of progress to all workers. In the U.S., the federal minimum wage for covered nonexempt employees is $7.25 per hour. However, most states also have their own minimum wage laws, and some states have laws that are higher than the federal rate. In cases where an employee is subject to both the state and federal minimum wage laws, they are entitled to the higher minimum wage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some worker groups are exempt from federal minimum wage laws. These include: \n",
      "\n",
      "- Independent contractors\n",
      "- Outside salespeople\n",
      "- Workers with disabilities\n",
      "- Full-time students\n",
      "- Youth under the age of 20 during their first 90 consecutive days of employment\n",
      "- Tipped employees\n",
      "\n",
      "However, even if a business or its employees are exempt from federal minimum wage law, they may still be covered by state or local law. For example, some states have minimum wage laws specific to tipped employees. \n",
      "\n",
      "Minimum wage laws should not be seen in isolation, but designed to supplement and reinforce other social and employment policies. They can help to overcome poverty and reduce inequality, including that between men and women.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, a minimum wage is beneficial for workers and a minimum wage should be universally applied to all jobs. However, in practice, this is not the case, and some workers are exempt from minimum wage laws.\n",
